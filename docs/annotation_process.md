## Annotation Process

In the labeling process, I categorized news headlines based on three sentiment classifications: positive (1), negative 
(-1), and neutral (0). Positive headlines highlight market or economic growth, such as stock gains, strong job markets, 
cooling inflation, or expectations of rate cuts, often containing keywords like "jumps," "rises," "record high," and 
"expands." Negative headlines emphasize economic or market risks, including stock declines, economic slowdowns, weak job 
markets, and rising inflation, often featuring words like "drops," "slowdown," "selloff," and "inflation hazard." Neutral 
headlines provide objective descriptions of market trends or policies without a clear positive or negative sentiment, 
often discussing economic data or events with mixed implications.

During labeling, I encountered challenges such as headlines containing both positive and negative factors, policy-related 
headlines, and economic data reports without clear sentiment. To address mixed sentiment headlines, I determined the 
dominant impactâ€”if both positive and negative elements were present, I assigned a neutral (0) label unless one aspect 
significantly outweighed the other. For policy changes, if a headline merely described a shift without implying 
consequences, it was labeled neutral, whereas if it indicated a clear economic impact, it was classified as positive or 
negative accordingly. Similarly, for economic data reports, I labeled them neutral if they were purely informational but 
positive or negative if they influenced market sentiment or exceeded expectations.

Overall, the labeling process was guided by sentiment-driven keywords, market impact, and policy direction. In complex 
cases, I assessed the dominant factor and market reactions to ensure accurate classification.
